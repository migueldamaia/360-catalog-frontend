# FRONT END 360 CATALOG FUNNEL

This project consists of home page for a demo / prototype for a 360 catalog visualizer, so that brands can convert their regular online catalogs for 360 visualizers, allowing users to see the products with more detail.
The demo itself is a 360 visualizer of a car.
Besides the demo, the home page allows users to simulate their costs of converting their catalogs to 360.
This is a sales funnel that takes in some information that will be sent to the api, that will store the form and do some pricing calculations.
The price is shown on the front end and the user has an option of receiving an email  with the prices.
